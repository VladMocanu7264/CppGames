# CppGames
Theese are my console ASCII games that I made during high school. They are not very andvanced but show my progression with progragramming over the years.

They were made specifically for my machine and require the Code::Blocks console to look fine.

For a good example check out my showcase video.

Here's the list:

X AND 0

- my very first game, made in the summer vacation before starting high school.

HANGMAN (Spanzuratoarea)

- made as a challenge, was completed in 3 hours.

MINESWEEPER

- created right after learning what two-dimensional arrays are.

HEADWARS 1.0

- a turn-based combat game that I created in the 9'th grade, that brute forces many aspects of programming.

HEADWARS 2.0

- the new and improved version of HEADWARS, a lot more algorithmical and much better.

SPACE INVADERS

- this little game has mtivated me to learn how time works in C++.

PING PONG

- made as a challenge as well.

PACMAN

- a close ASCII copy of the original. I tried simulating the ghost bahviours based on player vs ghost coordinates.

MAGICHEROES

- my best game made in high school without a game engine
- a 1v1 two player game
- 3 maps to play on
- 3 implemented heroes
- 1 normal fire, 1 passive and 1 ability for each
